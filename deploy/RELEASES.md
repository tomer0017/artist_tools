# Staging release log

Every release to `https://staging.185-176-255-3.sslip.io`, newest first, from
the release script's own log (`journalctl -u studio-release-*`; times UTC).
Each release built one exact commit of `migration/nextjs-saas-foundation`,
took a MongoDB dump first (since 9f16951), ran the additive migration, and
switched only after `/api/health?ready=1` answered. History is linear: every
commit below descends from the one before it (no rebases or force-pushes).

From the release after 56b9629 on, `GET /api/health` reports the running
commit (`version.commit`), so it can be checked over HTTPS alone.

| Released (UTC) | Commit | What changed | Data changes (migration) | Dump taken first |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-11 10:27–10:57 (built 10:26:40) | `3782e2c` | Everything since `56b9629`: CSP with nonces and body limits (`2785aa9`), billing core and `/admin/billing` (`9e046a2`), Hebrew studio frame (`56d5f3c`), accessibility fixes (`a58baa9`), retention in nightly maintenance (`c41c978`), docs | New empty billing collections and indexes (additive) | By the release script, which switches only after the dump, migration and health check succeed. Its log was not read: the VPS was unreachable over SSH afterwards. |
| 2026-11-11 01:28 | `56b9629` | Fix: `/he` pages served from real routes (a proxy rewrite returned 500 behind nginx) | none | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-11 01:20 | `6616888` | Phase 3a: English/Hebrew public pages, sign-in, emails, RTL, `/he` | none | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-11 00:48 | `40cbe24` | Phase 2b: versioned plans/prices, quotas, coupons, analytics (includes `ff080c8`) | `config_versions` seeded with today's plans (v1) and no prices; plans unchanged; new indexes | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-11 00:11 | `b2a06ea` | Phase 2a: admin filters, suspension, test accounts, promotional Pro, audit export (includes docs `6382183`) | new indexes only | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-10 23:36 | `9f16951` | Phase 1: email/password, account management, data export and deletion (includes `3d16ac4`, `e4fc94e`, `c942f21`) | 1 account given language/currency defaults; new indexes. Env: `APP_ENV=staging`, `AUTH_EMAIL_PASSWORD=on`, `MAIL_TRANSPORT=outbox` (previous env file: `/root/backups/phase1-20261110T233138Z/`) | `mongodb-20261110T233626Z` |
| 2026-11-10 16:3x | `77b92be` | Visitor journey, plans pages, tool introductions, Compare iPhone fix | — | `mongodb-20261110T163612Z` (manual) |

Nightly backups: the first scheduled run after the cron fix was verified on
the server on 2026-11-11 (`mongodb-20261111T014001Z`, 02:40 server time,
logged by cron).

Why staging moved from `77b92be` to `56b9629`: these are the five releases
above, all made deliberately during the 2026-11-10/11 session, each after the
full test suite passed. The owner's account (only user, only admin) was
checked in the database after `40cbe24`: role admin, plan Free, active,
Google sign-in unchanged. The releases directory keeps the newest five builds,
so `77b92be` is no longer on disk; going back to it means rebuilding it with
`studio-release staging 77b92be` (its code runs against the newer data, since
every migration was additive).

## Verification of `3782e2c` (2026-11-11)

- **Verified over HTTPS** (`deploy/smoke.sh`, 18/18, from the Mac at
  ~10:58Z):
  - `/api/health` reports `3782e2c`;
  - English and Hebrew public pages answer, `/he` included;
  - signed-out visitors are sent to sign-in from `/app` and `/admin`;
  - exactly one Content-Security-Policy (nginx adds none), with a new nonce
    on every request;
  - oversized bodies get 413.
- **Verified on the server** (SSH, ~12:50Z):
  - **The release log** of `studio-release-3782e2c-b`, which succeeded:
    - install 10:23:58, build 10:26:35;
    - database dump 10:29:10 (`mongodb-20261111T102910Z`);
    - migration 10:29:11: "34 indexes ensured, 0 configuration kinds
      published with defaults, 0 plans inserted, 0 plans updated, 0 accounts
      set to Free, 0 given default language and currency", so no data
      changed;
    - healthy and switched at 10:29:22.
  - **The billing indexes:** `subscriptions_by_updated`, `payments_by_time`,
    `payment_events_by_time`, `billing_customer_unique`, `payment_unique`,
    `payments_by_user`, `checkout_expiry_ttl`, `reconciliation_by_time`.
    The billing collections are empty.
  - **Configuration** unchanged: catalog v1 and pricing v1 published.
  - **The owner account:** admin, active, Free, `en`/USD, Google only, still
    the only user and admin, 4 live sessions. **A Google sign-in at
    12:42:36Z, after the release**, so a returning sign-in works on
    `3782e2c`.
  - Releases kept: `3782e2c 56b9629 6616888 40cbe24 b2a06ea`. `9f16951`
    was pruned (keep 5).

## Awaiting deployment

Nothing: `3782e2c` is live. `9cf33ec` (the smoke script and docs) changes no
running code.
