# Staging release log

Every release to `https://staging.185-176-255-3.sslip.io`, newest first, from
the release script's own log (`journalctl -u studio-release-*`; times UTC).
Each release built one exact commit of `migration/nextjs-saas-foundation`,
took a MongoDB dump first (since 9f16951), ran the additive migration, and
switched only after `/api/health?ready=1` answered. History is linear: every
commit below descends from the one before it (no rebases or force-pushes).

From the release after 56b9629 on, `GET /api/health` reports the running
commit (`version.commit`), so it can be checked over HTTPS alone.

| Released (UTC) | Commit | What changed | Data changes (migration) | Dump taken first |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-11 10:27–10:57 (built 10:26:40) | `3782e2c` | Everything since `56b9629`: CSP with nonces and body limits (`2785aa9`), billing core and `/admin/billing` (`9e046a2`), Hebrew studio frame (`56d5f3c`), accessibility fixes (`a58baa9`), retention in nightly maintenance (`c41c978`), docs | New empty billing collections and indexes (additive) | By the release script, which switches only after the dump, migration and health check succeed. Its log was not read: the VPS was unreachable over SSH afterwards. |
| 2026-11-11 01:28 | `56b9629` | Fix: `/he` pages served from real routes (a proxy rewrite returned 500 behind nginx) | none | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-11 01:20 | `6616888` | Phase 3a: English/Hebrew public pages, sign-in, emails, RTL, `/he` | none | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-11 00:48 | `40cbe24` | Phase 2b: versioned plans/prices, quotas, coupons, analytics (includes `ff080c8`) | `config_versions` seeded with today's plans (v1) and no prices; plans unchanged; new indexes | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-11 00:11 | `b2a06ea` | Phase 2a: admin filters, suspension, test accounts, promotional Pro, audit export (includes docs `6382183`) | new indexes only | yes (release step) |
| 2026-11-10 23:36 | `9f16951` | Phase 1: email/password, account management, data export and deletion (includes `3d16ac4`, `e4fc94e`, `c942f21`) | 1 account given language/currency defaults; new indexes. Env: `APP_ENV=staging`, `AUTH_EMAIL_PASSWORD=on`, `MAIL_TRANSPORT=outbox` (previous env file: `/root/backups/phase1-20261110T233138Z/`) | `mongodb-20261110T233626Z` |
| 2026-11-10 16:3x | `77b92be` | Visitor journey, plans pages, tool introductions, Compare iPhone fix | — | `mongodb-20261110T163612Z` (manual) |

Nightly backups: the first scheduled run after the cron fix was verified on
the server on 2026-11-11 (`mongodb-20261111T014001Z`, 02:40 server time,
logged by cron).

Why staging moved from `77b92be` to `56b9629`: these are the five releases
above, all made deliberately during the 2026-11-10/11 session, each after the
full test suite passed. The owner's account (only user, only admin) was
checked in the database after `40cbe24`: role admin, plan Free, active,
Google sign-in unchanged. The releases directory keeps the newest five builds,
so `77b92be` is no longer on disk; going back to it means rebuilding it with
`studio-release staging 77b92be` (its code runs against the newer data, since
every migration was additive).

## Verification of `3782e2c` (2026-11-11)

- **Verified over HTTPS** (`deploy/smoke.sh`, 18/18, from the Mac at
  ~10:58Z):
  - `/api/health` reports `3782e2c`;
  - English and Hebrew public pages answer, `/he` included;
  - signed-out visitors are sent to sign-in from `/app` and `/admin`;
  - exactly one Content-Security-Policy (nginx adds none), with a new nonce
    on every request;
  - oversized bodies get 413.
- **Not verified yet** (SSH timed out from the Mac after the release):
  - the release log (dump file name, migration output);
  - the new indexes in MongoDB;
  - the owner account (role admin, active) and that existing sessions
    survived;
  - signing in as the owner and as a returning user. The owner can confirm
    on the iPhone; the auth secret and session store did not change.
  - Commands for the next SSH session:
    `journalctl -u studio-release-3782e2c-b`, then the checks in
    `deploy/README.md`.

## Awaiting deployment

Nothing: `3782e2c` is live. `9cf33ec` (the smoke script and docs) changes no
running code.
